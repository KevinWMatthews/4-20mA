Tiny26_Timers

~~~ Timer 0 ~~~
Can be sourced from system clock CK, prescaled, CK or an external pin.

~TCCR0 - Timer/Counter0 Control Register
  Bits 7..4 Reserved

  Bit 3 - PSR0 (Prescaler Reset Timer/Counter0)
    Set to 1 to reset the Timer/Counter prescaler
    Bit will be cleared by hardware after the reset is finished.
    Always reads zero

  Bits 2..0 - CS02, CS01, CS00 (Clock Select0 Bits 2..0)
    000: Stop the timer
    See Table 31, pg 66 of the ATtiny26 datasheet
    001   CK/( 2^(n-1) )
    ..
    101   CK/( 2^(n-1) )
    110   External Pin T0, falling edge
    111   External Pin T1, rising edge

~TCNT0 (Timer/Counter0)
  8-bit register contains the value of Timer/Counter1
  Up-counter with read and write access
  Bit   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
      MSB                         LSB

~TIMER0, OVF0 (Timer/Counter0 Overflow)
  When timer0 matches or overflows it triggers the
  TIM0_OVF interrupt handler (ISR).


~~~ Timer 1 ~~~
Timer/Counter1 has a larger prescaler, which makes it more useful for lower speed functions or those that require exact timing with infrequent actions.

Timer1 has three interrupts:
  Match A
  Match B
  Overflow

Timer1 has three Output Compare Registers:
  OCR1A
  OCR1B
  OCR1C

OCR1A -> OC1A pin == PB1 pin -> Timer1 OC1A interrupt
OCR1B -> OC1B pin == PB3 pin -> Timer1 OC1B interrupt
OC41C -> overflow interrupt TOV1
  (either FF to 00 of OCR1C to 0)


Timer1 has three status flags (overflow and compare)
  TIFR

Timer has a PWM mode and Normal mode. PWM mode does what?

~ TCCR1A (Timer/Counter1 Control Register A)
Bits 7,6 - COM1A1, COM1A0 (Comparator A Output Mode)
  Determine output pin action when Compare Register A in Timer/Counter 1 matches.
  Affects Pin2/PB1 (OC1A).
    00 - Disconnected from output pin
    01 - Toggle output line
    10 - Clear output line
    11 - Set output line
  Must set Pin2's direction control bit to 1 to control it as an output pin.
  Different in PWM mode

Bits 5,4 - COM1B1, COM1B0 (Comparator B Output Mode)
  Determine output pin action when Compare Register B in Timer/Counter 1 matches.
  Affects Pin4/PB3 (OC1B).
    00 - Disconnected from output pin
    01 - Toggle output line
    10 - Clear output line
    11 - Set output line
  Must set Pin4's direction control bit to 1 to control it as an output pin.
  Different in PWM mode

Bit 3 - FOC1A (Force Output Compare Match 1A)
  Forces a change in the Compare Match output pin (Pin2/PB1/OC1A)
  Triggers a "match" regardless of the timer value.
  No interrupt is generated

Bit 2 - FOC1B (Force Output Compare Match 1B)
  Forces a change in the Compare Match output pin (Pin4/PB3/OC1B)
  Triggers a "match" regardless of the timer value.
  No interrupt is generated

Bit 1 - PWM1A (Pulse Width Modulator A Enable)
  Enable PWM mode

Bit 0 - PWM1B (Pulse Width Modulator B Enable)
  Enable PWM mode


~ TCCR1B (Timer/Counter1 Control Register B)
Bit 7 - CTC1 (Clear Timer/Counter on Compare Match)
  Set to 1 to reset Timer/Counter1 to $00 when a match occurs
  Set to 0 to allow Timer/Counter1 to continue unaffected and roll over when it reaches its max value.

Bit 6 - PSR1 (Prescaler Reset Timer/Counter1)
  Set to 1 to reset the Timer/Counter prescaler
  Bit will be cleared by hardware after the reset is finished.
  Always reads zero

Bit 5..4 Reserved

Bits 3..0 - CS13, CS13, CS11, CS10 (Clock Select Bits 3, 2, 1, 0)
  Define the prescaler:
  0000: stopped (use this to disable the timer)
  Clock will be set to (System Clock)/( 2^(n-1) )
    where n is the decimal value of these four bits.
  See Table 34 on pg 72 of the ATtiny26 datasheet


~ TCNT1 (Timer/Counter1)
  8-bit register contains the value of Timer/Counter1
  Bit   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
      MSB                         LSB

~OCR1A (Timer/Counter1 Output Compare Register A)
  8-bit value that will be continuously compared to Timer/Counter1
  Timer/Counter1 must count up to the OCR1A value
  A software write that sets TCNT1 and OCR1A to the same value does not generate a match!
  Actions to be taken on a match are specified in TCCR1A
  This register can not be cleared on a match?!

~OCR1B (Timer/Counter1 Output Compare Register B)
  8-bit value that will be continuously compared to Timer/Counter1
  Timer/Counter1 must count up to the OCR1B value
  A software write that sets TCNT1 and OCR1B to the same value does not generate a match!
  Actions to be taken on a match are specified in TCCR1A
  This register can not be cleared on a match?!

~OCR1C (Timer/Counter1 Output Compare Register C)
  8-bit value that will be continuously compared to Timer/Counter1
  Timer/Counter1 must count up to the OCR1B value
  A software write that sets TCNT1 and OCR1B to the same value does not generate a match!
  This register can be cleared on a match:
  If CTC1 in TCCR1B is set, a compare match clears TCNT1 and sets an Overflow Interrupt Flag (TOV1).

~PLLCSR (PLL Control and Status Register)
  Bits 7..3 Reserved

  Bit 2 - PCKE (PCK Enable)
    Set for asynchronous clock mode
      Uses fast 64MHz PCK clock as Timer/Counter1 clock source
    Clear for synchronous clock mode
      System Clock CK is used as timer source

  Bit 1 - PLLE (PLL Enable)
    Set to start PLL
      If system clock is the source this bit is always set to 1

  Bit 0 - PLOCK (PLL Lock Detector)
    Set PLOCK to lock PLL to the reference clock

To start Timer/Counter 1 in asynchronous mode:
  Enable PLL
  Poll PLOCK bit until it is set
  Set PCKE bit

What about in synchronous mode?

Which mode do we want?
