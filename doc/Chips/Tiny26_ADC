Tiny26_ADC

~ ADMUX (Multiplexer Selection Register) ~
Bits 7,6 - REFS1, REFS0 (Reference Selection)
  You can set the reference voltage to AVCC or to PA3 with a variety of options.
  Let's start with AVCC:
    Set bits 7,6 (REFS1, REFS0) of ADMUX to 00 to select AVCC as the reference voltage.

Bit 5 - ADLAR (Left Adjust Result)
  Set to 1 to left adjust the ADC reading.
  Set to 0 to right adjust the ADC reading.


Bits 4..0 MUX4..MUX0 (Analog Channel and Gain Selection)
  Use to select which analog input(s) are connected to the ADC. Also specifies 1x or 20x gain.
  Looks like you can only read from one ADC at a time!
    Set bits 4..0 of ADMUX to 00000 to select ADC0
    (Set bits 4..0 of ADMUX to 01010 [10 in binary] to select ADC10)


~ ADCSR (Control and Status Register) ~
Bit 7 - ADEN (Enable)
  Write 1 to enable the ADC, 0 to disable the ADC

Bit 6 - ADSC (Start Conversion)
  Write 1 to start a/all conversion(s)
    In Single Conversion mode, write 1 to start each conversion
    In Free Running mode, write 1 to start the first (and all successive) conversions.
    The first conversion may be a dummy conversion. Do this at startup! (I think).
  Writing 0 has no effect.
  ADC will read 1 when a conversion is in progress.
  Hardware will set to 0 when the conversion is finished.

Bit 5 - ADFR (Free Running select)
  Write 1 to operate in Free Running mode
    The ADC is constantly sampling and updating
  Write 0 return to Single Conversion mode
    each conversion must be initiated by the user

Bit 4 - ADIF (Interrupt Flag)
  Hardware sets this bit to 1 when an ADC conversion has been completed and data registers are updated.
  Hardware will also execute the ADC Conversion Complete Interrupt if:
    The ADIE bit is set
    The I-bit in SREG is set
  ADIF is cleared by:
    By hardware in the ADC Conversion Complete interrupt  OR
    Manually writing a 1 to ADIF

Bit 3 - ADIE (Interrupt Enable)
  When this bit is set and the I-bit in SREG is set, the ADC Conversion Complete Interrupt is activated.
  This can be used to scan multiple analog channels.

Bits 2.0 - ADPS2..0 (Prescaler Select)
  The ADC's input clock frequency must be between 50 and 200 kHz. Use a prescaler appropriately.
  Set the prescaler by:
    Setting the ADPS (PreScaler) bits in the ADCSR register
    These bits set the division factor to 2^n where
    n is expressed in binary in these three bits.


~ ADCH and ADCL (Data Registers)
The ADC generates a 10-bit result that is stored over two data registers:
  ADCH (High)
  ADCL (Low)
It is right adjusted by default, meaning:
  ADCH      ADCL
  xxxx xx98 7654 3210
ADCL must be read first.
Then ADCH is read.
Both must occur, and in this order!
Once ADCL is read the ADC can not put new readings in the data registers.
The ADC can only access the data registers after ADCH is read.



A normal ADC conversion takes 13 ADC (NOT main CPU) clock cycles.
That's a long time!!


Can look into Noise Reduction mode.
Can also look into hardware for noise cancelling.


For a single ended conversion, the resulting value is:
  ADC = (Vin*1024)/Vref


We might need to set the I-bit (bit 7) in SREG.
We also might need to set something in GIMSK or TIMSK.
Hopefully not ;)
