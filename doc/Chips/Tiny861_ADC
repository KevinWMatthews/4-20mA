Tiny861_ADC

~ ADMUX (Multiplexer Selection Register) ~
Bits 7:6 - REFS1:0 (Reference Selection)
  These bits work in conjunction with REFS2 from ADCSRB.
    Set bits 7:6 to 00 to select AVCC as the reference voltage and disconnect it from AREF. REFS 2 is not relevant in this case.

Bit 5 - ADLAR (Left Adjust Result)
  Set to 1 to left adjust the ADC reading.
  Set to 0 to right adjust the ADC reading.

Bits 4:0 - MUX4:0 (Analog Channel and Gain Selection)
  Use to select which analog input(s) are connected to the ADC. Also specifies 1x or 20x gain.
  Works in conjuction with the MUX5 bit of ADCSRB.
  Looks like you can only read from one ADC at a time!
    Set bits 4:0 of ADMUX to 00000 to select ADC0
    (Set bits 4:0 of ADMUX to 01010 [10 in binary] to select ADC10)
    Set bits 4:0 of ADMUX to 11111 [11 in binary] and bit 3 (MUX5) of ADCSRB to enable the internal temerature sensor!



~ ADCSRA (Control and Status Register A) ~
Bit 7 - ADEN (Enable)
  Write 1 to enable the ADC, 0 to disable the ADC

Bit 6 - ADSC (Start Conversion)
  Write 1 to start a/all conversion(s)
    In Single Conversion mode, write 1 to start each conversion
    In Free Running mode, write 1 to start the first (and all successive) conversions.
    The first conversion may be a dummy conversion. Do this at startup! This conversion will take 25 ADC clock cycles instead of the usual 13.
  Writing 0 has no effect.
  ADC will read 1 when a conversion is in progress.
  Hardware will set to 0 when the conversion is finished.

Bit 5 - ADATE (ADC Auto Trigger Enable)
  Write 1 to enable automatic triggering.
  The ADC will start on the positive edge of the trigger signal.
  The trigger source is selected by the ADTS bits in ADCSRB.

Bit 4 - ADIF (Interrupt Flag)
  Hardware sets this bit to 1 when an ADC conversion has been completed and data registers are updated.
  Hardware will also execute the ADC Conversion Complete Interrupt if:
    The ADIE bit is set  AND
    The I-bit in SREG is set
  ADIF is cleared by:
    By hardware in the ADC Conversion Complete interrupt  OR
    Manually writing a 1 to ADIF

Bit 3 - ADIE (Interrupt Enable)
  When this bit is set and the I-bit in SREG is set, the ADC Conversion Complete Interrupt is activated.
  This can be used to scan multiple analog channels.

Bits 2:0 - ADPS2:0 (Prescaler Select)
  The ADC's input clock frequency must be between 50 and 200 kHz. Use a prescaler appropriately.
  Set the prescaler by:
    Setting the ADPS (PreScaler) bits in the ADCSR register
    These bits set the division factor to 2^n where
    n is expressed in binary in these three bits.



~ ADCH and ADCL (Data Registers) ~
The ADC generates a 10-bit result that is stored over two data registers:
  ADCH (High)
  ADCL (Low)
It is right adjusted by default, meaning:
  ADCH      ADCL
  xxxx xx98 7654 3210

ADCL must be read first.
Then ADCH is read.
Both must occur, and in this order!
Once ADCL is read the ADC can not put new readings in the data registers.
The ADC can only access the data registers after ADCH is read.



~ ADCSRA (Control and Status Register A) ~
Bit 7 - BIN (Binary Input mode)
  ?

Bit 6 - GSEL (Gain Select)
  Write 1 to select:
    32x gain instead of 20x gain
    8x gain instead of 1x gain

Bit 5 - Reserved
  Always reads 0

Bit 4 - REFS2 (Reference Selection Bit 2)
  Works in conjunction with REFS1 and REFS2 in ADMUX.

Bit 3 - MUX5 (Analog Channel and Gain Sensor Bit 5)
  Works in conjunction with MUX4..MUX0 in ADMUX.

Bits 2:0 - ADTS2:0 (ADC Auto Trigger Source)
  If ADATE in ADCSRA is set to 1,
  these bits select which source will trigger an ADC conversion.



~ DIDR0 (Digital Input Disable Register 0) ~
Bits 7:4,2:0 - ADC6D:ADC0D (ADC6:0 Digital Input Disable)
  Set this bit to 1 to disable the digital input buffer on the corresponding ADC pin.
  Use this when an analog signal is applied to the ADC7:0 pin but the digital input (converted value) is not needed.
  This reduces power consumption.

Bit 3 - AREFD (AREF Digital Input Disable)
  Write 1 to disable the digital input buffer on the AREF pin.
  Do this whenever an analog signal is applied to the AREF pin but the digital input is not needed. This will reduce power consumption.


~ DIDR0 (Digital Input Disable Register 0) ~
Bits 7:4 â€“ ADC10D:ADC7D (ADC10:7 Digital Input Disable)
  Set this bit to 1 to disable the digital input buffer on the corresponding ADC pin.
  Use this when an analog signal is applied to the ADC7:0 pin but the digital input (converted value) is not needed.
  This reduces power consumption.
