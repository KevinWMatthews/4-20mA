TODO

Look into how/if to stub out <avr/io.h>. Is this a good design pattern?
Also need to figure out how to get this into the file list.
It IS already in the dependency list :)

Get test code to build using avr-gcc.

Is it possible to avoid recompiling tests unnecessarily? Each time we change any source code, the library must be recompiled, and this takes some time. It might be necessary; the tests need to run on the new source code, after all.

Rename CHECK null to CHECK_NULL_AND_RETURN

Look through 250 code to see how we select which LED to light up.

Add documentation to header files

Think hard about the ADC and AtoD task division.

Move pin functions and data type to its own file?
