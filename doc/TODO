Revise the ADC and AtoD task division.

Add documentation to header files



Want to document and streamline testing for NULL pointers for a generic multi-instance module.

Should we have a HardwareInit() function that calls all the HW Inits? We'll see how it all pans out....

Find a way to execute all of the unit tests.
We'll either need to navigate the subdirectories with a script (probably the best idea) or copy the test executables into another folder and run all of these.

Clean up avr-gcc compiler warnings (warnings with -Wall)!

Edit makefile to allow user to switch between hardware platforms. Will require directory reorganization!

Every set of tests recompiles the production code library. This is inefficient.
