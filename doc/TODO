Revamp tests in ADC to fix the holes that I left.

Add documentation to header files


Set up the AVCC and VCC with a 100 nF cap and a 10uH:
  The AVCC pin on the ATtiny26(L) should be connected to the digital V CC supply voltage via an LC network as shown in Figure 57.


Want to document and streamline testing for NULL pointers for a generic multi-instance module.

Should we have a HardwareInit() function that calls all the HW Inits? We'll see how it all pans out....

Find a way to execute all of the unit tests.
We'll either need to navigate the subdirectories with a script (probably the best idea) or copy the test executables into another folder and run all of these.

Clean up avr-gcc compiler warnings (warnings with -Wall)!

Edit makefile to allow user to switch between hardware platforms. Will require directory reorganization!

Every set of tests recompiles the production code library. This is inefficient.
