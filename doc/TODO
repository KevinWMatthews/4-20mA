Look into how/if to stub out <avr/io.h>. Is this a good design pattern?
Also need to figure out how to get this into the file list.
It IS already in the dependency list :)

Get test code to build using avr-gcc.

Is it possiblel to avoid recompiling tests unnecessarily? Each time we change any source code, the library must be recompiled, and this takes some time. It might be necessary; the tests need to run on the new source code, after all.
