TestList_ADC

Setup:
ADMUX:
  Select AVCC as the reference voltage.
  Select right adjusted data
  Select ADC0 as single ended input

ADCSR:
  Set to Single Conversion mode
  Set the Prescaler (need to depend on the main CPU frequency)
  Set the Interrupt Enable flag?
  Enable the ADC!
  Set ADSC to run the ADC initialization (dummy conversion).


~Start conversion:
  Verify that ADC is free.
  Start conversion

~Read from ADC:
Could use the interrupt handler, but let's do it manually for now. Should try both.
  Verify that ADC is free.
  Verify that the interrupt flag is set
  Read ADCL
  Read ADCH
  Bit shift result, store in 16-bit variable. Filter out top 6 bits of high register?
  Clear interrupt flag
  Return success


\Clear/reset ADC (?):
  Might need this in case one of our ADCL or ADCH reads fails.
  If we figure out that the ADC has gone bunk, try this:
    Read ADCL
    Read ADCH
  With any other prerequisites.
