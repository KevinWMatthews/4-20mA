TestList_LineFit

Map two integer points to floating point output.
Given two points, calculate the equation of the line between them.
The user is only interested in the y value.

We do want a multi-instance module. This project doesn't explicitly require it yet, but I have many projects that will use this.

~Initialize multi-instance module
~All functions handle NULL
~Set low point
~Set high point
~Calculate line
  ~Fail if vertical line
~GetOutput
  ~Points not set
  ~Horizontal line
  ~Fractional slope
  ~Fractional intercept
