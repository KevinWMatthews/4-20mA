TestList_LineFit

Map two integer points to floating point output.
Given two points, calculate the equation of the line between them.
The user is only interested in the y value.

We do want a multi-instance module. This project doesn't explicitly require it yet, but I have many projects that will use this.

~Initialize multi-instance module
Set low point.
Set high point.
Calculate line.
  Fail if both inputs are identical.
  Store m and b of y=mx+b
GetOutput
  Calculate y using y=mx+b
