Todo_Main

Initialize everything

  Loop:
if conversion start (delay too?)
  Get AtoD reading
  Convert into 4-20 reading (LineFit)


ServiceAllAlarms:
  Once per second:
    Start AtoD conversion.

  240 times per second:
    Send Reading to Display


Should ReadAtodValue() reset the conversion status if it's busy, i.e. should we force the program to wait until the next AtoD conversion is started?
