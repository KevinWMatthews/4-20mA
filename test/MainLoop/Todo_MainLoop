Todo_Main

Initialize everything

  Loop:
if conversion start (delay too?)
  Get AtoD reading
  Convert into 4-20 reading (LineFit)


ServiceAllCallbacks:
  Once per second:
    Start AtoD conversion.

  240 times per second:
    Send Reading to Display


Should ReadAtodValue() reset the conversion status if it's busy, i.e. should we force the program to wait until the next AtoD conversion is started?


Update the .h file's documentation.

Figure out how to round reading before updating the display

Probably want to split MainLoop_GetReading() into several descriptive functions. It seems to have multiple responsibilities:
  get raw counts from ADC
  Convert raw counts into reading
  Send reading to display
