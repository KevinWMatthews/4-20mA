Initialize everything

  Loop:
if conversion start (delay too?)
  Get Adc reading
  Convert into 4-20 reading (LineFit)


ServiceAllCallbacks:
  Once per second:
    Start Adc conversion.

  240 times per second:
    Send Reading to Display


Should ReadAdcValue() reset the conversion status if it's busy, i.e. should we force the program to wait until the next Adc conversion is started?


Update the .h file's documentation.


What amount of time should we use for the GetReading callback?
