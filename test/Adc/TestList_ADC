TestList_ADC

Simulate registers and verify that they are written to and read from.

Setup:
  ~SelectReferenceVoltage
  ~SelectResultAdjust
  ~SelectInputAndGainGain
  ~SetPrescaleFactor
  ~Enable
  ~FirstConversion

Main functionality:
  ~IsAdcBusy
  ~StartConversion
  ~IsInterruptFlagSet
  ReadDataRegister_High
  ReadDataRegister_Low
  ~ClearInterruptFlag


Deal with NULL pointers. What if the user doesn't run the init?
Check if registers are all 0 after initialization.

Figure out what if/how to include iotn26.h
This gets pulled in by <avr/io.h>
How will gcc know how to resolve this include?
Hmmmm.
In the short term, we could try using
#ifndef ADCSR
and
#ifndef ADMUX
to prevent compiler errors.
