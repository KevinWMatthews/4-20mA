    Clock frequencies:
Can we set up a timer to generate a 1kHz interrupt (once per ms)? Yes!!

ATtiny861 system clock defaults to 1MHz.

1MHz / 4 = 250000
If we set our 8-bit counter to match at 250, we'll get
250000 Hz / 250 = 1000 Hz
Interrupts at 1 kHz.

1MHz / 8 = 125000
If we set our 8-bit counter to match at 125, we'll get
125000 / 125 = 1000
Interrupts at 1 kHz!
Set timer prescaler to 8 and timer match to 125.
:)

8 mHz / 64 = 125000
If we set our 8-bit counter to match at 125, we'll get
125000 / 125 = 1000
Interrupts at 1 kHz.

We have options!
