Should we turn all pins off when we destroy?

Re-check all NULL tests, especially struct pointer and select pint

Change how we initialize the struct of data pins. Want to try using calloc and copying struct members so that we aren't dependent on the scoping of the init function.

Maybe we should move the select pin back to the number?
