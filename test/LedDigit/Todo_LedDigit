Todo_LedDigit

Implement set and show functions
Move select pin from LedNumber to LedDigit

Current Digit

Should we turn all pins off when we destroy?

IsDecimalShown?

checkStateOfAllPins doesn't need self?

Re-check all NULL tests with new pointers

Convert current_digit struct element to an enum

Think about pointer destroy. What should we set to null?

Do we need to manually clear the digit/pins on power-up?

Default case in SetDigit()?

Change how we initialize the struct of data pins. Want to try using calloc and copying struct members so that we aren't dependent on the scoping of the init function.
