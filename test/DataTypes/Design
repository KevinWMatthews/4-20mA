Design

Storing pin data in a struct may be useful but it is ineficcient:
  8 structs are needed to fully utilize a single 8-bit address.

Rather than storing the address and a bit, try using functions to encapsulate the behavior that we are interested in.

SetState(address, bit)
GetState(address, bit)
[later add a function that takes (address, bitmask)]


    There are two methods for solving this problem:
Pass in the memory address at a high level.
  This allows for easy testing.
  More memory use?
  I'm not sure that I like it....

Hard-code in an extra abstraction layer at the lowest level.
  This may reduce memory use.
  It certainly utilizes manufacturer-created header files to the fullest.

Rather than passing in Each module will have a low-level harware file that will contain hard-coded references: a wiring file.
