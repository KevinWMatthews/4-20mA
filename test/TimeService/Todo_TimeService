Todo_TimeService

TimeService needs to call a function at a given time interval.
It should support multiple functions.

Create should simply create the TimeService structures.

AddCallback should accept a function pointer for a callback and a time interval in milliseconds.

We'll need to figure out how to get this embedded system to delay properly.

Rename PeriodicCallback to PeriodicAlarmCallback?
