Rename PeriodicCallback to PeriodicAlarmCallback?

Ok, I think I want the counters to be in the same structs as their periods. Perhaps they don't have to be, but it will be MUCH more convenient.

We need to allow the interrupt to increment this counter.
We need to allow the interrupt to check this counter against the period and set a global flag.

We need to allow the main program to check the each counter and execute corresponding callbacks.

Ideally we'll be able to keep these function separate.

I'm going to try having several interfaces for the same file:
  Main: Create/Destroy, add/remove, set/get, service!
  Timer: Increment Counter

I think.

The struct will need to be public in a TimeService_Private header file

We'll create the Main and Timer files too (probably TimeSerice and TimeServiceInterrupt).

Figure out how to service the callbacks.


change alarm to self in function argument lists

change interrupt routine to handle all alarms

LOTS of NULL checks are missing...

Make sure that the executeNow flag is cleard by the service routine!!
