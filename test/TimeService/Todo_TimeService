Todo_TimeService

Think about splitting counter and period enums for clarity.
Perhaps we should add devoted activate anddeactivate functions.

Test deactivate() with nonconsecutive alarms?

Consider redesigning TimeService so that the callbacks can take a void pointer as an argument.
We'd have to service alarms individually but it makes them much more powerful.
