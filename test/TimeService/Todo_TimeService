Todo_TimeService

Think about splitting counter and period enums for clarity.
Perhaps we should add devoted activate anddeactivate functions.

Test deactivate() with nonconsecutive alarms?

Consider redesigning TimeService so that the callbacks can take a void pointer as an argument.
We'd have to service alarms individually but it makes them much more powerful.

Remove callback parameter demo (don't need the null demo, I think; we'll test that when we test/create the actual callback function).
Clean up the tests.
Try out a struct, even though I know it should work.
