    Clock frequencies:
Can we set up a timer to increment at 1ms? Yes!!

Clock0 has a prescaler up to 1024.
System clock can be set to 1, 2, 4, or 8 mHz in its default mode.

1mHz / 4 = 250000
If we set our 8-bit counter to match at 250, we will have
250000 Hz / 250 = 1000 Hz interrupts, or 1 interrupt per ms.
:)

8 mHz / 64 = 125000
If we set our 8-bit counter to match at 125, we'll get interrupts at 1 Hz.

We have options!
