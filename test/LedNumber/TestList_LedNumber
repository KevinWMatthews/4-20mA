Initialize:
  ~Number of digits
  !Location of decimal point

~Set nothing (clear)
~Set single digit
~Set n-digit number
Blank leading zeros
Set demical point location
Turn on LedDigits sequentially

Handle no LEDs?
Test wiring

Create creates digits
Destroy destroys digits


Multiple TurnOff calls
TurnOn without all LEDs initialized.

We're going to light up the LEDs sequentially.
All LEDs use the same Darlington IC; we'll use transistors to select which LED we're going to light up. Then we just do it > 60 Hz and the human eye shouldn't notice. :)

Something like this:
  Unselect all LEDs
  "Show" correct digit (set Darlington IC lines)
  Select LED (turn on transistor to supply voltage)
  (Delay for enough time to make the LED visible?)
