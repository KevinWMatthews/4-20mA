I think this can be a single-instance module.
Will we really have two displays? I guess we could easily have two readings... but we don't.

Initialize:
  !Number of digits
  !Location of decimal point
  xPins of Darlington?
  ~Pins for switching/selecting LEDs

Display single digit
Display two digit number
Display n-digit number
Blank leading zeros
Set demical point location
No LEDs?
Test wiring

Create creates digits
Destroy destroys digits

We're going to light up the LEDs sequentially.
All LEDs use the same Darlington IC; we'll use transistors to select which LED we're going to light up. Then we just do it > 60 Hz and the human eye shouldn't notice. :)

Something like this:
  Unselect all LEDs
  "Show" correct digit (set Darlington IC lines)
  Select LED (turn on transistor to supply voltage)
  (Delay for enough time to make the LED visible?)

This module has a direct hardware dependency (the transistor pins) as well as a software dependency (LedDigit).
