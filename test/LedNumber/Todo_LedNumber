Add decimal support, but later; we'll have to figure out what kind of behavior that we want.

What if we added 0 digits?

  Overflow checks:
Add return status to AddLedDigit() (what if we add too many digits?).
What if we display a three-digit number with only two LEDs?

What if a digit creation fails?

(?) Look at using LedNumber_DigitPlace in getDigitFromNumber()
