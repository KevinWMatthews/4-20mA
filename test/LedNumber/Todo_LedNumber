What if we display a three-digit number with only two LEDs?


//How to dynamically allocate an array pointers?
Define PIN struct and make it global.
That way we don't need **.

Then figure out how to do the dead drop (or do that first).

Figure out what to do with LedDigit wiring.
Populate number Destroy() with all digit Destroy() calls.

Test wiring - check that we don't wire too many pins (memory leak/array overflow)
Will need/want return code for _WirePin()
