Add decimal support, but later; we'll have to figure out what kind of behavior that we want.

  Overflow checks:
Add return status to AddLedDigit() (what if we add too many digits?).
What if we display a three-digit number with only two LEDs?

  Null checks
Check on behavior of Null data pins for LedNumber creation.
WHOA!! add null checks

Revise destroy() to make it more robust, clear non-null self even if *self is null? Make the test check for NULLs, etc
Test NULL select pins
Test NULL LedDigit pointers


Watch out for the assert in LedNumber...
Need to replace with a null check that can actually continue to run

Look at using LedNumber_DigitPlace in getDigitFromNumber()

Add tests to spy.
